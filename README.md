this game is created by me because i can't play osuðŸ™‚,
and this game also just for fun.
i'm really recommend to you play this game in mozilla firefox, because i don't know i didn't test this game on chrome or edge.
yeah maybe that all i'll update this game and support english languages i'll put english song to this game maybe if i want to do it, because,
i'm to lazy to search english song.
also thanks to play, cheers hiyo.

game was inspired by [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/), but i'm not playing osu!

game languages are indonesian and just little bit of english.
